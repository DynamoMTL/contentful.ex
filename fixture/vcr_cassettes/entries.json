collaborating with [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com) to integrate the NCCN Chemotherapy Order Templates (NCCN Templates<sup>Â®</sup>) into the Flatiron Health OncoEMR<sup>Â®</sup> electronic health record, starting initially with breast, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers, with plans to expand to additional tumor types.  \\n  \\n 'Breast, colon, and lung cancers are three of the most common cancers in the United States, and the decision to incorporate NCCN Templates, beginning with these three diseases, into OncoEMR indeed will enhance the safety and effectiveness of care for many patients in community and academic settings alike,â said Robert W. Carlson, MD, Chief Executive Officer, NCCN. âNCCN is eager to collaborate with Flatiron Health on this significant endeavor.â  \\n  \\n OncoEMR is a cloud-based electronic health record designed specifically for cancer centers. As part of this integration, cancer care providers will be able to easily select the NCCN Templates<sup>Â®</sup> directly within OncoEMR at the point of care.  \\n  \\n âWe are pleased to collaborate with NCCN on this new offering, which will enhance the delivery of care for patients across the Flatiron provider network,â said Robert J. Green, MD, Vice President, Clinical Strategy and Senior Medical Director, Flatiron Health. âSeamless, integrated access to the NCCN Templates within OncoEMR will assist physicians in referencing the latest evidence-based treatment regimens at the point of care.â  \\n  \\n In addition, OncoEMR will link to NCCN.org so that the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines<sup>Â®</sup>) are available to end users as a reference. The information contained in the NCCN Templates is based on the NCCN Guidelines<sup>Â®</sup>. NCCN Templates include chemotherapy and immunotherapy regimens with literature support, supportive care agents, monitoring parameters, and safety instructions.  \\n  \\n NCCN continues to add to the library of chemotherapy order templates to improve the safe and effective use of drugs and biologics in cancer care.  \\n  \\n The NCCN Templates enhance patient safety by assisting health care providers with standardization of patient care, reduction in medication errors, and anticipation and management of adverse effects.  \\n  \\n In January 2015, NCCN and Flatiron announced a collaboration to launch a novel oncology outcomes database to provide the opportunity to analyze key quality and outcomes metrics and identify trends and patterns in the care of patients with cancer.  \\n  \\n For more information about the NCCN Templates, visit [NCCN.org/templates](http://www.nccn.org/templates)  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nAbout the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\\n The National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup>Â®</sup> (NCCN<sup>Â®</sup>), a not-for-profit alliance of 26 of the worldâs leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education, is dedicated to improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of cancer care so that patients can live better lives.

'As a community oncologist who has worked with Flatiron over the past year, I know firsthand the power of the Flatiron platform and the enormous potential we have to improve the lives of patients. The fact that the founders felt that it was imperative to have a community oncologist as part of the team is a great indicator of both the value of community oncology, and the importance Flatiron places on it.'   \\n  \\n At Flatiron, Dr. Green will collaborate with physicians around the country to ensure that the Flatiron platform meets their needs and lives up to their expectations. He will help ensure that the combination of OncoEMR and OncoAnalytics forms the best-in-class platform for the advancement of cancer care. He will work closely with Dr. Amy Abernethy, Flatiron's Chief Medical Officer and a leading cancer data scientist, and Dr. Leo Nicacio, VP of Oncology, to help life science companies and data partners solve practical data and analytic problems and will contribute to the strategic vision of Flatiron Health.

And, his addition heralds our commitment to ensuring that the clinical and scientific insights gained through Flatiron data and technology are optimally informed by the needs of oncologists and patients in community settings across America.â   \\n  \\n\\nAbout Dr. Bobby Green\\n Robert J.

The round was led by Google Ventures with participation from First Round Capital, Laboratory Corporation of America, Great Oaks Capital, The Social+Capital Partnership, SV Angel, IA Ventures and angel investors. As a part of the financing, Dr. Krishna Yeshwant, general partner at Google Ventures and board member of Foundation Medicine, has joined Flatiron Healthâs board.  \\n  \\n Flatiron Health was founded in 2012 by Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg, two of the founders of Invite Media. Invite Media was an advertising technology and software company acquired by Google in 2010. After witnessing several family members and friends battle cancer, the founders began a journey to learn the inner workings of the oncology industry. Noticing that most cancer care centers, oncologists and researchers were deprived of even the most basic data analysis tools that other industries used daily, they decided to found Flatiron Health.  \\n  \\n âWeâre extremely excited to add a great group of investors to Flatiron Health,â said Nat Turner, Flatiron Healthâs co-founder. âSolving the big data problem in oncology is going to take much more than money, and weâre honored to be working with a group of firms and individuals who genuinely care about making that happen to make a difference in the world.â  \\n  \\n Flatiron Healthâs platform integrates a cancer centerâs disparate data systems to provide a truly longitudinal and comprehensive view of the patient population. Through the platform, administrators and clinicians gain deep analytics for business and clinical intelligence, resource utilization, treatment patterns, network management and research. In addition, cancer centers can monitor their adherence to national cancer care guidelines and benchmark their performance.  \\n  \\n âOncology is one of the fastest growing and unique segments of the health care industry, and oncologists and researchers need new and advanced tools to keep up,â said Dr. Krishna Yeshwant of Google Ventures. âNat and Zachâs passion to address this challenge and reputation for building disruptive software companies were key in our decision to lead the round. We are thrilled to be working with Flatiron Health as they build out a software platform that the oncology industry desperately needs.â  \\n  \\n The funds will be used to expand Flatiron Healthâs engineering and product teams. Flatiron Health is in private beta with a select group of providers and other partners in the United States.   \\n  \\n\\nAbout Flatiron Health, Inc.\\n Flatiron Health is a health care technology company building the industry's first data platform dedicated to oncology.

The financing round is being led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors First Round Capital and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp<sup>Â®</sup>). As a part of the financing, Andrew Conrad, Director at Google[X], will join Flatiron Healthâs board of directors.  \\n  \\n Flatiron has also reached an agreement to acquire Altos Solutions, Inc., a leading web-based oncology software company and developer of the OncoEMRâ¢ electronic medical record (EMR) system. Flatiron Health and Altos Solutions expect to finalize the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, by the end of May 2014. The combination of Flatiron Health and Altos Solutions, Inc. will create the worldâs largest single source of structured real-world oncology data and intelligence.  \\n  \\n Flatiron Health was founded in 2012 by Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg. The companyâs OncologyCloudâ¢ platform allows cancer centers, physicians and life science companies to gain unprecedented and actionable insights from clinical, practice management and billing data. Previously, this information was trapped in EMR systems and doctorsâ free-text notes. The Flatiron Health software platform accelerates personalized medicine and research by applying advanced analytics to electronic patient care data documented by physicians.  \\n  \\n Through the acquisition of Altos Solutions, Flatiron will combine point-of-care data capture and patient engagement with advanced analytics, allowing physicians and administrators to run smarter cancer centers, and patients to receive more coordinated and targeted care. The core application from Altos Solutions is OncoEMRâ¢, the industryâs leading oncology-specific EMR system. Over 1,300 oncology clinicians and thousands of users utilize Altos Solutionsâ software on a daily basis. Physicians using software powered by Altos Solutions see over 550,000 unique cancer patients each year. Over time, Flatiron Health and Altos Solutions will integrate the two platforms, allowing for seamless data flow, smarter data capture, and advanced decision support.  \\n  \\n âFlatironâs mission is to organize the worldâs oncology data and make it useful for patients, physicians, life sciences and researchers. Raising this amount of financing and acquiring Altos Solutions greatly accelerates that vision, and gives us the ability to help both oncologists and most importantly patients on a new level,â said Nat Turner, Co-Founder of Flatiron Health. âFlatiron will be a critical component to truly personalizing medicine by enabling the right patient to get the right therapy at the right time.â  \\n  \\n âAltos Solutions was founded for one simple reason: to improve the lives of patients by enhancing cancer care with technology,â said Carla Wood Balch, president of Altos Solutions. âBy joining forces with Flatiron Health, weâre going to deliver even stronger and more tightly integrated solutions to physicians, patients and life science companies.â   \\n  \\n Turner and Weinberg founded Flatiron Health after witnessing several family members and friends battle cancer. Noticing a growing trend of physicians documenting patient care electronically, but without advanced analytics or decision-support tools, they decided to create a software platform that accelerated personalized medicine and research by making sense of this data at scale. Google acquired their previous company, Invite Media, in 2010.   \\n  \\n âCancer will likely touch all of us at some point in our lifetimes, either as a patient or as the family or friend of a patient. Flatiron has pioneered a way to learn much more about cancer, so that we can improve the way we care for patients and treat the disease,' said Dr. Krishna Yeshwant, a general partner at Google Ventures. 'It's rare to find a team of the caliber assembled by Flatiron Health that combines pragmatic insights from the healthcare industry with the deep technical insight of the IT industry. They are working on one of the biggest problems in healthcare, and their progress has been nothing short of stunning to date.'  \\n  \\n Flatiron Healthâs OncologyCloudâ¢ platform has applications for both cancer care providers and life science companies. For providers, the first application is OncoAnalyticsâ¢, a web-based software package that seamlessly integrates a cancer centerâs disparate data systems, and provides real-time business and clinical intelligence with benchmarking. In the near future, providers will be able to leverage de-identified data from other cancer centers on the platform in a HIPAA-compliant manner.   \\n  \\n For life science companies, OncologyCloudâ¢ provides a âsystem of recordâ for how cancer care is delivered in the real world, offering a real-time view of treatment utilization, sequencing and outcomes. Life science companies will soon be able to utilize OncologyCloudâ¢ to accelerate research by matching patients to available clinical trials and automating data collection. The foundation of the OncologyCloudâ¢ platform is its data transformation engine, which extracts, processes and cleans both structured and unstructured data in real-time towards a standardized ontology.  \\n  \\n Altos Solutions will continue to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary of Flatiron Health. Flatiron Health will continue to support cancer centers that use other EMR systems with the launch of the Flatiron Federated (FF) integration layer. Flatiron expects to expand its cloud-based platform to health care specialties beyond oncology starting in 2015.   \\n  \\n\\nAbout Flatiron Health, Inc.\\n Flatiron Health is a health care technology company and operator of the OncologyCloudâ¢ platform.
