With his brother (an engineer specializing in system design and data visualization), Michael used his background as a Ph.D. chemist with 30 years experience in data analysis to develop a complex algorithm that produces a score capturing gradual but important changes in patientsâ conditions in easy-to-read graphs.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Previously, during an 18-year career at IBM Corp., Michael was an engineer in computer science and artificial intelligence at IBMâs T.J. Watson Research Laboratory and developed models that led to a doubling of chip yields at the companyâs Microelectronics Division. As manager and executive consultant for the IBM Consulting Group, he specialized in transforming mathematical results into business strategies for major banks and financial institutions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Later, as senior vice president for strategic information for First USA Bank, Michael established a more effective approach to interact with customers and developed a database to better determine their preferences.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In 2000, he founded Michael Rothman &amp; Associates to focus on data analysis and product development through consulting, patent filing and joint ventures. Projects have included developing a system generating customized discharge forms for hospitals, helping determine cash flow and profitability for a pharmaceutical companyâs newly introduced drugs, and pro bono work analyzing puppy mortality data for a guide dog school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Michael received bachelorâs and masterâs of science degrees in chemistry from Brown University and a

The RI Score gives a visual picture of a patientâs condition and progress in a simple, single numeric score that is graphed over time. Tracking the score allows family members and clinicians to better understand a patientâs condition and potential decline over time. The case study shows that the clarity and simplicity of the RI Score allows more frank discussions of prognosis and consideration of comfort measures, in this case resulting in timely transfer to hospice.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The article, published in BMJ Case Reports, details the decline in health of an 85-year-old man, and the use of the RI Score by his family and caregivers as they discussed end-of-life planning. The use of an objective measure to chart patient condition allows the physician to maintain empathy in family discussions, while being realistic about imminent death.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âThis case report highlights the value of the Rothman Index as a Universal Patient Score, creating a simple, objective measure of a patientâs health that can be used across the continuum of care,â said Stephanie Alexander, CEO of PeraHealth. âIn this report, the RI Score creates a common understanding that facilitates the often difficult conversations around end of life.

Moreover, the study found that the Rothman Indexâs composite measure of patient condition, automatically extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), substantially reduced false positives, a common shortcoming of MEWS systems. MEWS is currently used in various forms by hospitals worldwide.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âA key advantage of the Rothman Index Score is its use of more than 50 measures, all calculated in real time from existing EHR data, with no manual inputs from busy hospital staff,â said Stephanie Alexander, CEO of PeraHealth. MEWS uses four vital signs and one neurologic assessment that depend on periodic hand scoring by nurses and timely notification of physicians. âThe Rothman Index Score takes the same measures used by MEWS and adds lab results, clinical assessments and additional vital signs, creating a new composite score that is clinically validated,â continued Alexander.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Rothman Indexâs superior performance and wider range of uses, including minute-by-minute recalculations when attached to sensors in Intensive Care Units, may âassist earlier detection of deterioration, providing a chance to avoid medical crises,â the study said.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âThis is the first peer-reviewed comparison of the Rothman Index with the early-warning systems typically used in hospitals,â said Michael J. Rothman, Chief Science Officer of PeraHealth. âThe Rothman Index enables clinicians to visualize changes in acuity by simple line graphs personalized to each patient at any point in time across the trajectory of care.â Rothman co-developed the Rothman Index algorithm with his brother Steven after their mother died in 2003 from an undetected complication.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The study compared MEWS and Rothman Index scores computed for more than 32,000 patient visits at Abington (Pa.) Memorial Hospital, a 665-bed regional teaching hospital, from July 2009 through June 2010. It follows earlier peer-reviewed studies that validated the Rothman Indexâs effectiveness across all disease categories and across patient populations and in reducing costly hospital readmissions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    About PeraHealth Inc.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    PeraHealth is transforming healthcare through the intelligent use of data. By leveraging the Rothman Index, a validated patient acuity score, PeraHealth software solutions enable healthcare providers to identify at-risk patients sooner for earlier intervention. Leading hospitals and health systems utilize PeraHealthâs real-time, predictive analytics to improve quality and reduce costs. Clinical results include lowering mortality rates by as much as 30%.

Essentially, in the pediatric intensive care unit here, weâre taking care of the sickest patients in western Pennsylvania. Thereâs a lot of information. We can have hundreds of orders on a single patient a day and we can have 100 lab values for patients a day. If you add in vital signs data and things like that, thereâs just megabytes of information that need to be filtered and processed. If we tried to do that just with our trainees and nurses and physicians, we would be in a sea of data without directions.

As chief executive officer, Ms. Alexander and her team are collaborating with PeraHealthâs customers to develop applications for pediatric, assisted-living, home health and other patient populations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The software extracts, synthesizes and visualizes data buried in Electronic Heath Records to create a score that captures gradual but important trends in patientsâ condition in easy-to-read, color-coded graphs. The effectiveness of the software has been validated through analysis of 250,000 patient visits since its introduction in 2005. It has helped reduce hospital readmissions, improve continuity of care and patient flow, enhance rapid-response team performance and achieve financial savings.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âIt has been reported that in an average four-day hospital stay, there are 24 handoffs. We have focused our research on developing a tool to help doctors and nurses detect subtle changes that can be missed as a patient is handed off from one provider to the next. As we integrate vital signs, lab results and particularly nursing assessments, which are often underused, into a single score, we can see subtle trends in patient condition,â said company co-founder Michael Rothman. âNow with Stephanieâs proven leadership, in partnership with our customers, we are ready to help all healthcare providers and patientsâ family members more effectively monitor patientsâ health.â\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Michael Rothman and his brother Steven, both experts in data analysis, developed the Rothman Index after their mother, Florence Rothman, died in 2003 when a deteriorating trend went undetected following a relatively low-risk surgical procedure. Since then, a dozen hospitals have introduced the index in partnerships to improve patient quality outcomes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âAs one of the original users of PeraHealthâs product, we are excited to extend our strategic partnership to improve clinical quality,â said Thomas J. Balcezak, M.D., Senior Vice President, Patient Safety and Quality and Associate Chief of Staff for Yale-New Haven Hospital, a nationally recognized, 1,541-bed, not-for-profit hospital that serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Yale School of Medicine. âWe are proud to have contributed significantly to the validation of an index to improve the safety and experience of patients and their families as well as increase our hospitalsâ operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.â\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âIn addition to Yale New Haven Health System, PeraHealthâs solutions have been implemented in a broad range of facilities from the nationâs top health systems and leading community hospitals to skilled-nursing, assisted-living and independent-living settings, reflecting our vision of providing service across the continuum of care,â said Ms. Alexander.

2015)</em> â <a href=\\\"http://www.chop.edu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia</a> (CHOP) will begin using software from <a href=\\\"http://www.perahealth.com/\\\">PeraHealth</a> to improve clinician awareness of children who may be at risk for clinical deterioration while in the hospital.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    CHOP will use PeraHealthâs full suite of real-time clinical surveillance software â including the pediatric Rothman Index (pRI) â at CHOPâs Main Campus inpatient location where the software will be integrated into their existing electronic health record (EHR). PeraHealth and CHOP will also collaborate on research intended to improve the delivery of pediatric care.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âCHOP is committed to providing children and their families with safe, effective, family-centered, timely and efficient care,â said Evan Fieldston, MD, MBA, MSHP, attending physician of general pediatrics and medical director of clinical operations at CHOP. âWe believe PeraHealth software will help our clinicians to better identify children at risk for worsening conditions so they can intervene in a timely and appropriate manner.â\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A disease-agnostic universal score for predicting pediatric patient mortality risk, the pRI is calculated in real time using data from any major EHR system. The score is then presented in color-coded graphs that trend patient condition over time and across any care setting, alerting clinicians earlier to subtle but potentially serious health problems.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a href=\\\"http://www.perahealth.com/discover/news/peer-review-childrens-hospital-of-pittsburgh-of-upmcs-electronic-surveillance-framework-could-significantly-reduce-false-positive-diagnoses/\\\">Recent peer-reviewed research</a> found the pRI helps identify and alert clinicians to patients needing urgent intervention. This sensitivity to identify patients in need of attention is paired with a low false-positive rate. According to the research, the pRI had a false-positive rate of just 1 percent, compared to 46 percent for simply monitoring vital signs, a common indicator of patient condition.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    âSince many symptoms of potentially life-threatening pediatric conditions are also found with common, non-critical illnesses, itâs often a challenge for providers to recognize when immediate medical attention is needed,â said <a href=\\\"http://www.perahealth.com/about/leadership/perahealth-executives/\\\">PeraHealth CEO Stephanie Alexander</a>. âBy trending and clearly presenting disparate data from any care setting or patient population, PeraHealth solutions offer clinicians a full picture of a childâs condition, both in the moment and trended over time. We look forward to assisting CHOP in its never-ending quest to provide safer, more integrated care.â\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nationally, clinicians use PeraHealth solutions to:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Remotely monitor patients across multiple care settings and enhance preemptive rapid response team intervention;\\n    </li>\\n    <li>Help determine when to discharge patients;\\n    </li>\\n    <li>Prioritize patient bedside visits and nursing assignments;\\n    </li>\\n    <li>Improve accuracy and timeliness of documentation; and\\n    </li>\\n    <li>Optimize ICU bed use.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n    About PeraHealth<br>\\n    PeraHealth is transforming healthcare through the intelligent use of data.
